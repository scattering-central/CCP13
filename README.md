## CCP13 Legacy Software

[Collaborative Computational Project](http://www.ccp.ac.uk) 13 was a hugely successful software project that started in January 1992.

In addition to developing useful software for the analysis of data from fibres and other oriented soft matter systems, CCP13 spawned the journal _Fibre Diffraction Review_, and acted as a global lynch pin for its experimental community. But in 2005 the UK Research Councils responsible for CCP13 withdrew any prospect of continuation funding.

Since that time, members of the last Steering Committee have been working to secure CCP13's legacy for future generations of scatterers. In this they have had some success.

It is hoped that by making the original source code available to developers in the community, future generations of small-angle scatterers can continue to benefit from the CCP13 legacy whilst also providing a route for future development and maintenance of the software.

Compiled versions of these programs can be found on the [SAS Portal](http://smallangle.org/content/Software)
