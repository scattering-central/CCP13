# CCP13

## CCP13 Legacy Software

CCP13 was a hugely successful software project that started in January 1992.

In addition to developing useful software for the analysis of SAS and fibre data, CCP13 spawned the journal Fibre Diffraction Review, and acted as a global lynch pin for the community.

In 2005 the UK research councils responsible for CCP13 withdrew any prospect of continuation funding. Since that time members of the last Steering Committee have been working to secure CCP13's legacy for future generations of scatterers. In this they have had some success.

It is hoped that by making the original CCP13 source code available to developers in the community that this success can be shared with the entire small angle scattering community whilst also providing a route towards future development and maintenance of this software.

Complied versions of these programs can be found on the [SAS Portal](http://smallangle.org/content/Software)
