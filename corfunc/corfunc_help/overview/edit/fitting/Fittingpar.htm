<p>These parameters are used in the <a href="../../actions/extrapolation/Extrapolation.htm">extrapolation</a>
process, in which the data are extrapolated to q = 0 and q = infinity prior
to calculating any transforms.
<p>In order to extrapolate to q = 0,
the first genuine data points after the beamstop are fitted with either
a Guinier or Vonk profile (see <a href="../../actions/extrapolation/Extrapolation.htm">Extrapolation</a>).
The profile type is selected by the user in the window shown in Figure
1.
<p>In order to extrapolate to q = infinity, the tail of the intensity data
is fitted with a sigmoid or Porod function (see <a href="../../actions/extrapolation/Extrapolation.htm">Extrapolation</a>).
Again, this function is selected by the user in the window shown in Figure
1. The user must select the following limits to be used in these fitting
procedures:
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The x-axis value at the first genuine data point after the beamstop,
  and
<br>(b) The x-axis values at the beginning and end of the data to be used
in the tail-fitting.
<br>&nbsp;

<br><b>Figure 2: </b>The limits for extrapolation
<br>&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>These limits are chosen by moving the red limit markers within the data
display window as shown in Figure 2 (to display the data, select the <b>Data
</b>item
in the <a href="../../display/Display.htm">Display</a> menu). The markers
are moved by selecting the marker with the right-hand mouse button and
then dragging the marker to the desired position while keeping the button
depressed. The first marker from the left is taken to be the start of the
genuine data, and the next two markers are taken as the limits of the data
to be used in tail-fitting.
<p>If these tail-fitting limits vary from frame
to frame in the case of real-time data, then variable tail-fitting limits
can be used by selecting the <b>Variable limits for tail fit</b> checkbox
and then clicking on <b>Edit limits</b> to display the window shown in
Figure 3. The limits for the various frames in the dataset can then be
selected frame-by-frame. <i>But the user must specify limits for all frames in
the dataset, even if not all these frames are to be processed</i> (see <a href="../general/Generalpar.htm">General
parameters</a>). Once entered in the text fields, the limits can be added
to the list by clicking the <b>Add </b>button. The <b>Delete</b> button
removes the last element in the list.
<p>The limits will be applied once the
user clicks on the <b>Accept</b> button. Clicking on the <b>Cancel</b>
button or closing the window will cause all changes since the window was
opened to be undone.

<p>The least-squares fitting of the tail will be performed to convergence,
or to the maximum number of iterations selected by the user in the window
shown in Figure 1. The user will receive a warning if the maximum number
of iterations is reached without convergence.
