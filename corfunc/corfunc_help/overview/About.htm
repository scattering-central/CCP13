<b><font size="+1">About <i>CORFUNC</i></font></b><p>The set of routines that comprise <i>CORFUNC</i>
were originally written in 1994 at the behest of <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/ryan/index.php">Tony
Ryan</a> by <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/BSUsite/AboutUs/People/thomas.shtml">Thomas
(Tom) Nye</a> whilst an undergraduate in Applied Mathematics at the
University of Cambridge, and are based on the earlier work of <a href="http://frsl06.physik.uni-freiburg.de/index.html">Gert
Strobl</a> (Universität Freiburg) and co-workers in the 1980's (see <a href="references/References.htm">References</a>).
The polydispersity analysis was proposed later by <a href="mailto:g.eeckhaut@skynet.be">Guy
Eeckhaut</a> (ex-ICI).<p>The
original UNIX source was ported to the PC/Windows<sup>TM</sup> environment and
given a Java<sup>TM</sup> GUI by CCP13 Post-Doctoral workers Richard Denny and
Mark Shotton in 1999.<p>The alternative Hilbert transform (volume fraction
profile) analysis of Trevor Crowley (ex-Salford University) and co-workers (see <a href="references/References.htm">References</a>)
was suggested by <a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/LargeScale/LOQ/scientists.htm">Steve
King</a> (<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/">ISIS&nbsp;Facility</a>). Its
incorporation was
started by
CCP13 Post-Doctoral worker Matthew Rodman and
finally implemented in 2004 by Steve King and <a href="mailto:D.W.Flannery@rl.ac.uk">Damian
Flannery</a> (<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/">ISIS&nbsp;Facility</a>), with
help from <a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/LargeScale/LOQ/scientists.htm">Richard
Heenan</a> (<a href="http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/">ISIS Facility</a>).<p>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><b>About
Java</b></font><b><sup>TM</sup></b><p><i>CORFUNC</i> requires Java<sup>TM</sup>;
please download the Java 2 Run-time Environment (J2RE) from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
(you do <i>not</i> require the Software Development Kit, SDK). <i>CORFUNC</i>
Version 1.3 has been extensively tested with Java 2 Version 1.3.1. though at the
time of writing the current release is Version 1.4.2. During limited testing
under Version 1.4.2 a small compilation time error was discovered. This has been
corrected by changing the <i>CORFUNC</i> Java code but should perhaps serve as
an indication that other run time &quot;peculiarities&quot; may exist. If you
think you find one, please notify the CCP13 Software Development Team (<a href="http://www.ccp13.ac.uk/committee/committee.htm">http://www.ccp13.ac.uk/committee/committee.htm</a>).<p>&nbsp;<p>Steve King, August 2004.
