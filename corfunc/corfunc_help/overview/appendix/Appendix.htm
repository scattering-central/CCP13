<p><b>8.1 Ideal Lamellar Morphology</b>
<p>The ideal lamellar model consists of alternating crystalline and amorphous
lamellae that are placed in stacks of dimensions that are large enough
not to affect the small angle scattering <a href="../references/References.htm">[7]</a>.
The model is assumed to be isotropic<i> i.e. </i>no preferred orientation
is accounted for. The correlation function of such a system varies in one
direction only, perpendicular to the lamellae. The variation of the correlation
function in this direction is described by the one-dimensional correlation
function (see <a href="../actions/transform/Transform.htm">Transform</a>,
<a href="../actions/extraction/Extraction.htm">Extraction</a>
and <a href="../Overview.htm">Overview</a>).
