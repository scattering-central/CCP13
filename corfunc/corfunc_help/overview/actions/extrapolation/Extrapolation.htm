<p>Prior to calculating either transform of the scattering data (see <a href="../../Overview.htm">Overview</a>
and <a href="../transform/Transform.htm">Transform</a>), the data must
first be extrapolated to q = 0 and q = infinity to avoid the introduction
of series termination errors in the transform. This can be performed by
selecting the <b>Extrapolate</b> item from the <b><a href="../Actions.htm">Actions</a></b>
menu.
<br>
<p><b>4.1.1 Extrapolation to q = 0</b>
<p>The data are extrapolated to q = 0 by fitting a Guinier or Vonk model
to the first few genuine data points after the beamstop. If the experimental
data do not contain an upturn in intensity at low q, back extrapolation
may fail. The first genuine data point is indicated by the red limit marker
on the left of the scattering data graph as shown in Figure 1. This limit marker
can be moved by dragging it with the right-hand mouse button. The <i>CORFUNC </i>program
will attempt to set a sensible initial value for this limit.
<p>Fitting functions for back-extrapolation:
<br>&nbsp;
<table COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>I(q) = A e^(Bq&sup2;)</td>

<td>Guinier</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>I(q) = H<font size=-2>1</font> - H<font size=-2>2</font>q&sup2;</td>

<td>Vonk</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The Guinier model assumes that the small angle scattering arises from particles
and that parameter B is related to the radius of gyration of those particles.
This has dubious applicability to polymer systems. However, the correlation
function is affected by the Guinier back-extrapolation to the greatest
extent at large values of R (see <a href="../../Overview.htm">Overview</a>
and <a href="../extraction/Extraction.htm">Extraction of parameters</a>)
and so the back-extrapolation only has a small effect on the analysis.

<p>The Guinier back-extrapolation <i>must</i> be selected if <i>CORFUNC</i> is
being used to generate a volume fraction profile.
<br><p>&nbsp;<b>4.1.2 Extrapolation to q = infinity</b>
<p>The data are extrapolated to q = infinity by fitting either a Porod
<a href="../../references/References.htm">[3]</a>
or sigmoid <a href="../../references/References.htm">[4]</a> function to
the tail of the scattering data (see <a href="../../edit/fitting/Fittingpar.htm">Fitting
Parameters</a>). The "tail" of the data is taken as those data lying between
the two red limit markers on the right of the scattering data graph as shown
in Figure 1. These can be moved by dragging them with the right-hand mouse
button. If these limits vary from frame to frame, in the case of real-time
data, variable tail limits can also be chosen (see <a href="../../edit/fitting/Fittingpar.htm">Fitting
Parameters</a>).
<p>Tail-fitting functions:
<br>&nbsp;
<table COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>I(q) = B + (K/q^4)e^(-q&sup2;&#963;&sup2;)</td>

<td>Sigmoid</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>I(q) = B + (K/q^4)</td>

<td>Porod</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>where B = Bonart thermal background
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; K = Porod constant
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#963;
describes the electron (or neutron scattering length) density profile at the interface between crystalline
and amorphous regions. (see Figure 2)
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p><img SRC="fig3.GIF" height=296 width=461>
<p><b>Figure 2: </b>The value of &#963; is a measure of the electron
density profile at the interface between crystalline and amorphous regions.
<br>&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>The sigmoid function should generally be chosen for tail-fitting. This
fitting is accomplished by the use of a Levenburg-Marquart non-linear least-squares
fitting algorithm <a href="../../references/References.htm">[5]</a>
. Using a Porod function usually yields a poor quality
correlation function, but a greater number of structural parameters can
be extracted (see <a href="../extraction/Extraction.htm">Extraction of
parameters</a>) . The fitting of the Porod function is a linear problem.<p>The
Porod function should be selected if <i>CORFUNC</i> is being used to generate a
volume fraction profile.

<p>The tail-fitting will be performed to convergence or until the maximum
number of iterations (see <a href="../../edit/fitting/Fittingpar.htm">Fitting
Parameters</a>) has been reached. The user will be warned if the maximum
number of iterations has been reached without convergence and may consider
increasing this number and repeating the extrapolation.
<p>The tail-fit affects the correlation function at low values of R (see
<a href="../../Overview.htm">Overview</a>
and <a href="../extraction/Extraction.htm">Extraction of parameters</a>)
which is the most important region in the extraction of ideal lamellar
morphology parameters. Hence it is vital to obtain a good fit to this tail.
<p>Transformation is actually performed by numerical integration (see
<a href="../transform/Transform.htm">Transform</a>)
and uses extrapolated data up to q = 0.6, not infinity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><b>4.1.3 Smoothing</b>
<p>The extrapolated data set consists of the Guinier or Vonk back-extrapolation
up to the first genuine data point, the original scattering data up to the first
tail-fitting limit and the sigmoid or Porod tail-fit beyond this. It is shown
as the magenta-coloured line in Figure 1. The join between the original
scattering data and tail-fit is smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay <a href="../../references/References.htm">[5]</a>
smoothing algorithm that smoothes the data without greatly altering higher
moments. This avoids the formation of ripples in the transformed function
which would otherwise occur with a period matching the d-spacing of the join. No
smoothing is used at the join of the back-extrapolation to the scattering data.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4.1.4 Output</b><b></b>
<p>Once the extrapolation process is complete, the extrapolated data will
be shown superimposed on the original scattering data as shown in Figure 1. Note
that this extrapolated data has the Bonart background added to it for the
purposes of comparison. Background-subtracted data is actually used in
the <a href="../transform/transform.htm">Transform</a> process.<p>The following files are output during the extrapolation process (assuming
scattering data filename
A01000.nnn and q-axis file X00000.nnn where n is any alphanumeric character):

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4.1.6 Tips</b>
<p>(1) Avoid choosing a noisy region for tail-fitting.
<p>(2) If the back-extrapolation fails with one type of function, try using the 
other.
<p>(3) Check correlation functions and volume fraction profiles for fluctuations with periods
corresponding
to the truncation point of q = 0.6 (10.5 &Aring;) and the point at
which the tail-fit joins the scattering data.
