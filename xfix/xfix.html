<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>XFIX is designed to help ascertain some important parameters of a
fibre diffraction pattern with the aid of an OSF/Motif-based
graphical user interface (GUI). The job of the GUI is to handle the
display images, collect information specifying regions of the data
and to communicate with the program FIX which performs much of the
underlying data-processing.</P>

<P>Information such as the pattern centre, detector orientation,
fibre tilt can be estimated and refined and putative unit cells can
be plotted over the pattern. In addition, more general functions are
available such as the capability to plot and fit integrated slices or
scans through the pattern.</P>

<H3>The XFIX Main Window</H3>

<P>The top part of the main window is comprised of a menubar, some
text fields for displaying the current file name, the current frame
number, the (x,y) coordinates of the pointer, the (interpolated)
value at the pointer coordinates and two arrow buttons to switch
between images either side of a text field which indicates the
current image number. If no file has been specified, the image number
field is blank. Once a file has been specified, the first image
displayed (the whole frame) is numbered zero.</P>

<P>The middle part contains the large scrolled image area, the
magnified area, two text fields for specifying the current display
thresholds, two push buttons for inverting the current palette and
refreshing the display and a set of toggle buttons used to specify
subsequent behaviour and use of the pointer and mouse buttons.</P>

<P>The bottom part contains a scrolled text window for displaying
output from the processing program, FIX and commands sent to FIX by
the XFIX interface.</P>

<H3><A NAME="MENU1"></A>The File Menu</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>New ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This allows the user to specify a file using the BSL File
   Selection interface. A new XFIX interface will then appear with
   the specified file loaded.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Open ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This allows the user to specify a file using the BSL File
   Selection interface. The specified file will then be loaded into
   XFIX.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Next Frame</STRONG><BR>
   
   This loads the next frame from a multi-frame file.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Save As Postscript ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This saves the current image as a Postscript file.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Quit</STRONG><BR>
   
   This exits the program, subject to confirmation by the user.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="MENU2"></A>The Edit Menu</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>Parameters ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes the Parameter Editor dialog to appear. This interface
   is used to specify wavelength, sample to detector distance,
   detector centre and orientation, sample tilt. If a calibration
   ring is present on the image it may be useful to specify the
   calibrant d-spacing in order to calculate the sample to detector
   distance. Even if the default values for the wavelength and
   calibrant d-spacing are known to be correct, it is necessary to
   "OK" or "Apply" the values using this interface so that the sample
   to detector distance is calculated.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Objects ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes the Object Editor dialog to appear. This interface
   handles some of the items which can be collected from the data:
   points, rectangles, polygons and sectors. These items can be
   selected in the editor and will then be highlighted in image
   window (objects are normally labelled white on a black background;
   selection causes the background to become red). Selected objects
   will be used if estimation of the pattern centre, detector
   rotation or sample tilt is performed. If no objects are selected
   and one of these functions is requested all objects will be used.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Lines ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes the Line Editor dialog to appear. This interface
   handles lines and thicklines collected from the data. These items
   are labelled white on a blue background; selection causes the
   background to become green. Selected lines can be plotted or
   fitted. If no lines are selected and plotting or fitting is
   requested, all lines are processed.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Scans ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes the Scan Editor dialog to appear. This interface
   handles radial or azimuthal scans collected from the data. These
   items are labelled white on a blue background; selection causes
   the background to become green. Selected scans can be plotted or
   fitted with radial or azimuthal averaging. If no scans are
   selected and plotting or fitting is requested, all scans are
   processed.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Cell ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This interface is used to specify unit cell lengths and angles and
   the missetting angles of the unit cell away from the fibre axis.
   The cell parameters can be used to generate reciprocal lattice
   points which are listed and mapped onto the diffraction pattern
   within the specified resolution range.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="MENU3"></A>The Estimate Menu</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>Centre</STRONG><BR>
   
   The centre of the pattern is estimated using the objects defined
   by the Object Editor. If three or more points are available, the
   estimation is made by fitting a circle to the objects. If the
   wavelength or calibrant spacing have been specified using the
   Parameter Editor, the option is given to calculate the sample to
   detector distance.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Rotation</STRONG><BR>
   
   The rotation of the pattern is estimated using a pairs of objects
   defined by the Object Editor. It is usually sufficient to select
   one pair of objects related by mirror symmetry across the meridian
   as the rotation can be refined later.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Tilt</STRONG><BR>
   
   The tilt of the sample is estimated using a pairs of points
   defined by the Object Editor. It is usually sufficient to select
   one pair of points related by mirror symmetry (for an untilted
   sample) across the equator as the tilt can be refined later.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="MENU4"></A>The Process Menu</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>List Objects</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes FIX to calculate and list the filespace, standard
   (i.e. centred and rotated) and reciprocal space coordinates for
   each object if the required parameters have been entered or
   determined for each calculation.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Plot Lines ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes selected lines to be plotted (and possibly fitted)
   using the XFIT interface to FIT. If no lines are selected, all
   lines are plotted.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Plot Scans ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes selected scans to be plotted (and possibly fitted)
   using the XFIT interface to FIT. If no scans are selected, all
   scans are plotted.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Refine ...</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes the Refine Dialog interface to appear. The parameters
   for the refinement can be chosen and clicking on "OK" starts the
   refinement. The refinement algorithm uses the current image as
   data, mapping the coordinates of the image into the four quadrants
   of reciprocal space in order to compare the data in the quadrants
   and minimize the variance between quadrants. This means that the
   current image should be carefully chosen (not too big, but not so
   small that there is little contrast in the image, not too close to
   the equator if sample tilt is being refined but the intensity on
   the image should be present on all four quadrants of the image).
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="MENU5"></A>The Options Menu</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>Palette &gt;</STRONG><BR>
   
   This contains options for a grey scale and various colour
   representations of the pixel values.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Magnification &gt;</STRONG><BR>
   
   This contains options for the factor applied in the magnification
   window.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Line Colour &gt;</STRONG><BR>
   
   This contains options for the colour with which crosses, rectangles,
   sectors and circles will be drawn.
    
   <LI><STRONG>Lattice Point Colour &gt;</STRONG><BR>
   
   This contains options for the colour with which lattice points
   will be drawn.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Log Scale</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes subsequent threshold changes to scale the data on a
   logarithmic scale.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Interpolate</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes subsequent images to be interpolated to fit the
   current image window size. This happens automatically for zoomed
   images.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Fit Lines/Scans</STRONG><BR>
   
   This allows subsequent plots of lines or scans to be fitted.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Show Lattice Points</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes subsequently generated lattice points to be drawn onto
   the current image. If there are any lattice points in memory,
   these will be drawn immediately.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Azimuthal Scan</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes subsequently plotted scans to be integrated radially
   and the integrated values to be plotted as a function of angle.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Radial Scan</STRONG><BR>
   
   This causes subsequently plotted scans to be integrated
   azimuthally and the integrated values to be plotted as a function
   of radius.
</UL>

<H3>The Help Menu</H3>

<P>The HTML help documents are displayed in your current Netscape Web
browser.</P>

<H3>Image Thresholds Selection</H3>

<P>The threshold values for displaying the current image can be set
by editing the threshold text fields (labelled "High" and "Low") and
hitting &lt;return&gt;. When an image is first loaded, the thresholds
are set to the maximum and minimum values in the data for that image.
</P>

<H3>Inverting the Current Palette</H3>

<P>The "Invert Palette" button reverses the colour scale of the
current palette.</P>

<H3>Refreshing the Image Display</H3>

<P>The "Refresh" button can be used to redraw the image windows. This
can be useful if another application has modified the colour map or
if it is desired to erase circles or crosses drawn by FIX.</P>

<H3><A NAME="TOOLS"></A>Data Collection Tools</H3>

<P>To facilitate collection of various data items from the current
image, a set of toggle buttons is provided which determine the
behaviour of the mouse buttons and pointer.</P>

<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>Points</STRONG><BR>
   
   "Points" mode causes the image in the magnification window to
   track the position of the pointer in the main image window. Points
   can be created by clicking the left-hand mouse button.
   Alternatively, tracking of the pointer can be frozen by clicking
   on the middle mouse button and the point can then be positioned in
   the magnification window using the left-hand mouse button.
   Tracking of the pointer can be restarted by clicking on the
   right-hand mouse button in either the main image or magnification
   windows. On creation, the point is numbered and displayed in the
   Object Editor.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Lines</STRONG><BR>
   
   This mode allows lines to be created by holding down left-hand
   mouse button and dragging the pointer to select the starting
   point, the end point being selected in a similar way using the
   middle mouse button. The line is not created until the right-hand
   mouse button is pressed to indicate that the user is satisfied
   with the start and end points selected. While the pointer is being
   dragged, its position is tracked by the magnification window
   unless the tracking has previously been frozen while the interface
   was in "Points" mode. If this is the case, lines can also be
   selected from the magnification window. On creation, the line is
   numbered and displayed in the Line Editor.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Thick Lines</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is similar to "Lines" mode except that the line is now
   considered to have a width and is drawn as a rectangular box. The
   width of the box can be adjusted by holding down the &lt;shift&gt;
   key while holding down the left-hand mouse button and dragging the
   pointer.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Rectangles</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is essentially similar to "Lines" mode, except that the
   left-hand mouse button selects the top left-hand corner of the
   rectangle and the middle mouse button selects the bottom
   right-hand corner of the rectangle. On creation, the centre of the
   rectangle is marked with a cross and the rectangle is numbered (as
   an object) and displayed in the Object Editor. Centring is
   achieved by averaging data values along the perimeter of the
   rectangle to obtain a background value. This value is then
   subtracted from data points interior to the rectangle and the
   centre of gravity of the modified values is calculated.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Polygons</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is similar to "Rectangle" mode except that the left-hand
   mouse button selects a vertex, the middle mouse button deletes the
   last vertex and the right-hand mouse button closes and creates the
   polygon.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Sectors</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is essentially similar to "Rectangle" mode except that the
   left-hand mouse button selects the starting angle and radius and
   the middle mouse button selects the end angle and radius. Radii
   are measured from the pattern centre as defined in the Parameter
   Editor and angles are positive going anticlockwise on the image.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Scans</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is similar to "Sector" mode except that the parameters
   describing the area chosen are stored so that scans can be
   produced: a radial scan implies averaging over an arc defined by the 
   azimuthal range for each radius while an azimuthal scan implies averaging 
   over radius. On creation, the scan is numbered and displayed in the Scan 
   Editor.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Zoom</STRONG><BR>
   
   This is essentially similar to "Rectangle" mode except that the
   rectangle chosen is blown up to the current size of the main image
   window using bilinear interpolation to find intermediate pixel
   values.
</UL>

<H2>Plotting and Fitting</H2>

<P>Lines and scans can be plotted and fitted using many of the
interfaces developed for the <A HREF="xfit.html">XFIT</A> program which 
utilizes <A HREF="http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/index.html">PGPLOT</A> 
graphics. Plotting is activated using the "Plot Lines/Scans" button in 
the "Process" menu. In the following description, where the word "line" 
is used, "scan" could be substituted.</P>

<H3>Channel Selection</H3>

<P>When a line is plotted the distance between the start and end
points of the line is divided into a sequence of channels, the length
of a channel corresponding to the size of a data pixel. The values
placed into the channels are found by interpolation of the data
values. The first and last channels for plotting can be entered in
the Channel Dialog box which appears soon after plotting has been
activated. Clicking on the "Cancel" button in the Channel Dialog box
will cause XFIX to move on to the next line selected for plotting.
</P>

<H3>Plot Thresholds Selection</H3>

<P>When the data for the line are plotted, the thresholds for the
plot will be the minimum and maximum channel values present in the
selected channels. If necessary, these can be altered by entering the
appropriate values into the Threshold dialog box. Clicking on the
"Cancel" button in the Threshold Dialog box will cause XFIX to move
on to the next line selected for plotting.</P>

<H3>Selection of the region to be used in the fit</H3>

<P>If the data is to be fitted ("Fit Lines/Scans" has been selected
in the "Options" menu), the user can choose to delimit the region to
be used in the fit using the Limit Dialog box. The limits can then be
selected by clicking on the plot with any mouse button. Once the limits 
of the region have been selected, the plot will be redrawn using only 
the required region.
</P>

<H3>Peak Type Selection</H3>

<P>Six peak types are available:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="1" CELLSPACING="2">
   <TR><TH>Peak type                         <TH> Key <TH> Parameters

   <TR><TD>Double exponential                <TD ALIGN=center>  x  <TD ALIGN=center>  4
</TABLE>

<P>The selection is made by pressing the appropriate key while the
focus is in the plot window. All subsequent peaks will be of the same
type until a different peak type is selected. The default peak type
is Gaussian.</P>

<H3>Peak Parameters</H3>

<P>The formulae used for the different peak types give different
meanings to the descriptions width and shape. In what follows, the
position of the peak is assumed to be at the origin of the x-axis, h
is the height of the peak, w is the width and s is the shape. Peak widths
are the full width at half maximum (FWHM) unless otherwise stated.</P>

   When s = 1, the Pearson VII is equivalent to a Lorentzian but as s
   increases, the peak becomes more Gaussian in character.
   
   <LI><STRONG>Voigt</STRONG><BR>
   
   The Voigt is a convolution of a Lorentzian with a Gaussian. 
   The shape parameter, s, corresponds to the ratio of the width of the 
   Lorentzian to the width of the Gaussian, w. Therefore, when s = 0, the 
   resulting curve is a Gaussian of width w. This can be expressed as:<BR>
   <MATH>y = h Integral <BOX>e<SUP>-4ln2(t/w)<SUP>2</SUP></SUP>/

<H3>Peak Parameter Selection</H3>

<P>A peak of the current type is initialized for fitting to the data
when the left mouse button is pressed. The position of the peak is
determined by the X coordinate of the cursor when the button is
pressed. The width of the peak is determined simultaneously by the Y
coordinate of the cursor. The height of the peak is given by the Y
value of the data point nearest to the peak position.</P>

<H3>Background Selection</H3>

<P>A polynomial of degree 4 or less, expressed as<BR>

a<SUB>3</SUB>x<SUP>3</SUP> + a<SUB>4</SUB>x<SUP>4</SUP></MATH><BR>

can be fitted as background to the data. The degree of the polynomial
can be selected by using the keys &lt;1&gt;,...,&lt;4&gt; while the
focus is in the plot window. The default polynomial degree is 3.</P>

<P>An exponential component can be added into the background by
pressing &lt;e&gt; while the focus is in the plot window. This will
add two parameters to the fit to define the exponential curve,<BR>

<MATH>e<SUB>1</SUB>e<SUP>e<SUB>2</SUB>x</SUP></MATH>.</P>

<P>Once all the required peak and background parameters have been
initialized, selection can be terminated by clicking on the right
mouse button while the focus is in the plot window.</P>

<H3>Controlling the fit</H3>

<P>Some control over the fitting procedure can be excercised through
the Setup Dialog box. This interface provides a list of all the
parameters in the fit with their current values displayed in text
fields so that they can be easily modified. There is also an option
menu associated with each parameter. The following selections can be
made from this menu:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Free</B> - if a parameter has been previously constrained
   using the other options, it is released to be a free parameter in
   the fit.
   
   <LI><B>Set</B> - fix the value of a parameter to the value in the
   text field. The parameter is effectively removed from the fit.
   
   <LI><B>Limit...</B> - this causes the Limit dialog box to appear.
   This has a label to show you the parameter number you are limiting
   and a brief description of the parameter. Two text fields are
   available for setting limits on the value of the parameter. The
   parameter number can be incremented by use of the arrow buttons
   next to the parameter number. Activation of the arrow buttons has
   the effect of applying the limits to the previous parameter.
   
   <LI><B>Tie...</B> - this causes the Tie dialog box to appear. This
   has a label to show you which parameter you are tying and a brief
   description of the parameter. A text field is available for
   setting the parameter number to which the dependent parameter will
   be tied. A brief description of the independent parameter is
   updated when the apply button is activated. An option menu is
   available to specify the type of constraint to be applied to the
   dependent parameter. These are either an equality constraint or
   simple lattice constraints, i.e. applying (h,k) indices for
   hexagonal and tetragonal lattice positions or (h,k,l) indices for
   cubic lattice positions. These must be relative to the (1,0) or
   (1,0,0) positions, respectively. The parameter number can be
   incremented by use of the arrow buttons next to the parameter
   number. Activation of the arrow buttons has the effect of applying
   the tie constraint for the previous parameter. N.B. xfit always
   ties the higher parameter number to the lower one and modifies the
   Tie dialog and Setup dialog boxes to reflect this. It is not
   possible to make a compound tie constraint unless the constraint
   is one of equality, e.g. to tie parameter 8 to parameter 5 as the
   (1,1) hexagonal position and then tie parameter 5 to parameter to
   parameter 2 as the (2,0) tetragonal position.
</UL>

<P>The three buttons at the bottom of the Setup dialog box have the
following effects:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>PLOT</B> - this allows you to plot the curve corresponding
   to the (modified) parameter set.
<P>
   
   <LI><B>STEP</B> - this makes &lt;Step_its&gt; linearized least-squares 
   iterations.
   This is useful in seeing if the current model has a good chance of
   converging to the global minimum. The refinement may converge
   after a step. If the converged solution is satisfactory click on
   "RUN" to continue.
<P>
   
   <LI><B>RUN</B> - this allows the algorithm to continue to
   convergence or to the maximum number of iterations (&lt;+Max_its&gt; 
   + number of iterations already performed).
<P>

   The algorithm is deemed to have converged when the following two conditions 
   are fulfilled:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>&chi;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>current</SUB> &lt; &chi;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>previous</SUB>
<LI>&chi;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>previous</SUB> - &chi;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>current</SUB>
&lt; &chi;<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>current</SUB> * &lt;Chi-test&gt;

<P>Clicking on "Yes" in the "Try Again" Confirm Dialog box will give
you another attempt at fitting the current frame starting from the
point where you select the peak types, positions, etc. The Setup
Dialog box will disappear and the Information Dialog box will appear,
reiterating the procedure for setting up the initial model. Clicking
on "No" will cause XFIX to proceed onto the next line.</P>
